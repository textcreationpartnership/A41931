            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I know the concern which the common cauſe of our poor Countrey gives you, will make the following Account not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie to you, ſince hereby you may ſee how ſpeedy the Preparations are which we find here for the Relief of our Countrey.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> the Twentieth, the General his Grace the Duke of <hi>Schomberge</hi> was received here with all the uſual Formalities about Nine at Night, which being ſo late, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Guns which lay ready charged on the Caſtle Walls to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him, from being fired, leſt their noiſe might terrifie the Adjacent Countrey. He Lodges at Alderman <hi>Mannering</hi>'s in <hi>Water gate-ſtreet.</hi> The place of the General Encampment is a little above the South-ſide of the River <hi>Dee,</hi> Eaſtward of the Bridge, where there were laſt <hi>Wedneſday</hi> but two Regiments Encampt, <hi>viz.</hi> A Battallion of the Kings Guards, and Count <hi>Carlſoom</hi>'s Regiment, and ſince then three more are Encampt, <hi>i. e.</hi> The Lord <hi>Lisborn</hi>'s Regiment Blew and Yellow, which came in the laſt <hi>Wedneſday;</hi> The Lord <hi>Herbert</hi>'s Blew and White came in the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, and then the Earl of <hi>Drog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heda</hi>'s which Quartered in this Town, and was Superſeded by Sir
<pb facs="tcp:45589:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Henry Ingoldesby</hi>'s, which is ſaid here is to be left as a Defence for this place; perhaps you will not think the following Relation unworthy your notice.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Wedneſday</hi> laſt, a Souldier in the Lord <hi>Drogheda</hi>'s Regiment was ſhot at the head of the Camp for Deſerting, and his Son, whom he had ſeduced along with him, was to run the Gauntlet, a leſs puniſhment; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the commands of a Father might be prevailing; but he was pardoned. The ſame day alſo the Lords Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals had a moſt ſumptuous Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment at Sir <hi>John Morgans,</hi> the Governour, in the Caſtle, which was made more ſolemn by the ſhooting of many great Guns from off the Walls. A great ſight of Baggage and Artillery lies here in the <hi>Roodee</hi> to be ſhipt out of hand for <hi>Ireland.</hi> There is likewiſe expected in here this morning a Regiment of <hi>French</hi> Cadees, which all here expect to be a very fine ſight. The Conflux of People hither to ſee the Camp from all parts of the Countrey, is ſo great, that this Town might be almoſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for <hi>England's Metropolis;</hi> and yet there is no Diſtemper here ſo violent, as you write me was the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in <hi>London,</hi> conſidering what vaſt numbers are hereabouts. Two days ago there came into <hi>Neſſou</hi> a ſmall Wherry, which put off from <hi>Arcloe,</hi> a Town in the County of <hi>Wicklow,</hi> with ſeveral Paſſengers in her, that give but Diſmal Relations of the Poſture the poor <hi>Engliſh</hi> are in at <hi>Dublin:</hi> Moſt of the Eminent men of that City, they ſay, are Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, among whom, as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed (and I made pretty ſtrict Enquiry) are Sir <hi>Humphrey Jervis,</hi> Mr. <hi>Roſe</hi> the Merchant in <hi>Thomas</hi> Street, and Doctor <hi>King;</hi> in him you may ſee how little a Good man is eſteemed there.</p>
            <p>I cannot forbear to add this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Deliverance at <hi>Derry;</hi> for a Bomb fell into a Garret in an upper Story, in which were forty men; the Bomb fell on a beam, and bounced upward; ſo fired the Houſe, without killing any one of the men.</p>
            <p>I forgot to tell you in its place that the Duke on <hi>Tueſday</hi> in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, on his return from <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lake,</hi> Accompanied by the Lord <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and a numerous Train of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Officers and Gentlemen, view'd the Ground deſigned for the Camp, and then thoſe two Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which were Encamped, whom he paſt by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

Several Houſes here are filled with Bread, Cheeſe, Bacon, Oats, Oat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal, and other Belly-proviſions for both Horſe and Man. I am,</p>
